This challenge required refactoring HTML and CSS code that lacked fundamental accessibility features, including but not limited to proper semantics, minimal redundancy, and functional page links. In addition, this project served as practice in documenting coding progress, not only using notes within the HTML and CSS files themselves but also notes in the form of Git commit comments.
